== Introduction
The purpose of this Developer Guide is to provide useful information to software developers who desire to contribute to the project (e.g. optimizing of code, adding test cases, etc.), including an overview of the software architecture, design as well as current implementations and intended functionality of current features. The police database is for police officers(PO) and headquarters personnel(HQP). Both groups will have varying access and authorization levels to this database. POs would be able to read from the database after screening someone while on patrol and choose his course of action base on the status/threat level of subject. HQP would have the added functions of adding and removing people from the database. Refer to quick start to get started.

== Setting up
To set up the project successfully on your computer, follow the steps below.

=== Prerequisites
In order to start the setup, you are required to install the following:

* JDK 9 or later
* IntelliJ IDE

=== Importing the project into IntelliJ

. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. If JDK 9 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 9
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Run the `seedu.addressbook.Main` class (right-click the `Main` class and click `Run Main.main()`) and try executing a few commands
. Run all the tests (right-click the `test` folder, and click `Run 'All Tests'`) and ensure that they pass
. Open the `StorageFile` file and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=java.xml.bind' to module compiler options`

== Implementation
This section describes some of the more important details of certain features implemented.

*1a. Password Feature*

Users and passwords are stored in passwordStorage.txt in the format: USER PASSWORD.
This is to simplify reading the line by splitting the line using the whitespace.
Each user and corresponding password are in stored in one line.
Since each line refers to one user, the reader can loop through each line to check for a specific user and password.
Passwords are stored in hashcoded form so that even if passwordStorage.txt is deleted, the system still cannot be accessed.
Headquarters Personnel have full access to all the commands while Police officers cannot Add, Clear, Check, Delete, Edit nor Update password.

When the device is locked, User has to enter a specific password to grant user the level of access requested.
A buffered reader reads through the whole file to match the password entered.
If the password is wrong, the user has 5 attempts left. This number decreases with each wrong password.
The system shuts down after 5 wrong passwords.
This is to ensure that the system denies access to anyone who is not authorized.

The User can enter the lock command at any time to ensure that the device is logged out immediately.

Alternatives considered:
- using an internal hashmap to store user and passwords. Difficult to observe how many POs are there.
- Storing password in plaintext . Passwords can be seen in passwordStorage.txt
- Allowing any number of attempts to unlock device. Can be easily looped to try all passwords.

*1b. Update Password Feature*

Headquarters Personnel can update any stored password with the update password command.
The buffered reader reads the passwordStorage.txt file for the specific password to change.
Once the user has entered a new password, he is prompted to enter the same password again.
This is to ensure that the password typed is accurate.
However, the new password must be alphanumeric and at least 5 characters long.
This is to ensure a strong password.
The print writer then loops over the passwordStorage.txt file and places all existing passwords into a new temporary file, while placing the new password over the old password.
The temporary file is renamed to passwordStorage.txt and the original file containing the old password is deleted.

Alternatives considered:
- Update password one time, without secondary prompt to enter password. This will make the changes permanent even if a mistake is made.
- Updating using any password, without validity. Password may be weak.
- Overwriting passwordStorage.txt . This will cause errors in replacing password.

*2a. "find" command (edited)*

The new "find" command is revised from the existing "find" command in AB3. Instead of finding a person by name, it finds a person using his NRIC.
It also implements the following operations:

. execute() - executes the "find" command itself and displays the result to the user.
. getPersonWithNric() - Searches the addressbook to retrieve the person with the specified NRIC.

The following is an example usage scenario of the "find" command:

Step 1: The user input his password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: The user executes "find s1234567a" command where the first argument is the command word "find" and the second argument is the NRIC to be
searched, which in this case is "s1234567a" (all letter are lower cased). The "find" command calls execute() which also calls getPersonWithNric() method.

Step 3: The getPersonWithNric() method searches the addressbook for the person with "s1234567a" if he exists and person is stored in a list.

Step 4: The person is found and is stored in a matchedPerson list variable. execute() returns a CommandResult using the matchedPerson list as its argument.

Step 5: The CommandResult object displays to the user the searched person and his details, all of which in string form.

*2b. "check" command*

Only a HQP may use this command. This command displays the timestamps of which a person with the specified NRIC was screened using the "find" command.
The "check" command makes some use of the "find" command. Every time the "find" command successfully finds a person, a line in the format of:
"NRIC timestamp" is printed in a text file called "ScreeningHistory.txt". The "check" command will read this file and retrieve the timestamps
corresponding to the specified NRIC. Below is an example of its usage:

Step 1: The user(a HQP) input his password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: The user executes "check s1234567a" where the first argument is the command word "check" and the second is the NRIC to be checked which in is "s1234567a".

Step 3: The "check" command calls execute() which calls the getPersonWithNric() method. This method will read the ScreeningHistory.txt line by line, where each line
is in the format of "NRIC timestamp", for example "s1234567a 18/10/2018-20:38:42". Each line is split into the NRIC and timestamp. If line[0] is the NRIC specified,
the corresponding timestamp is stored in a list.

Step 4: The list from step 3 gets returned by execute() to create a CommandResult object which displays all the timestamps to the user.



*3a. "showunread" command*

==== Current Implementation

Once system is unlocked, regardless of which user you are, you can use this command. This command lists the new/unread messages in your inbox based on the password you used to unlock the system.
When messages are sent, they are stored inside a text file called "inboxMessages/'userID'", where 'userID' refers to the ID of the intended recipient.
These text files store messages directed to each individual who can log in and access their personalised inbox.
It also implements the following operations:

. execute() - executes the "showunread" command itself and displays the result to the user.
. loadMessages() - Searches the text file storing messages for the specific police officer identified by the userID and loads it into a data structure, sorting the messages according to how urgent they should be attended to (sorted first by read status, followed by priority and then the time the message was written).
. Loaded messages are then concatenated in a single string as `fullPrintedMessage` and passed to the main window through CommandResult.

The following is an example usage scenario of the "showunread" command:

Step 1: The user input his password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: The user executes "showunread" command. The "showunread" command calls execute() which also calls getMessagesFor() method.

Step 3: The getMessagesFor() method searches message storage file for the messages directed to the respective user, if any, and they are stored into a data structure.

Step 4: The messages that are found and are stored in a TreeSet, split by its read status, message priority, timestamp, and the message itself for sorting purposes. execute() returns a CommandResult using the messages list as its argument.

Step 5: The CommandResult object displays to the user the number of unread messages he has, and the list of unread messages sorted according to their urgency.


Alternatives considered:
* Using a List instead of a TreeSet.
** Pros: Smaller space complexity.
** Cons: Less efficient code as 'sort' function must be called every time a new message is stored to maintain sorted order.
Eventually, we decided to use TreeSet in our implementation as we felt that the pros outweighed the cons. This becomes more obvious when the amount of data stored gets larger.

* Using a single text file for storing messages, storing the userID of the recipient in the text file.
** Pros: Fewer files to manage and filepaths to traverse.
** Cons: Less efficient as it means more memory is required for storage per message stored (additional information of recipient of message required to be stored in the data structure itself when loaded).
Eventually, we also used multiple message storage files, each dedicated to a specific user, as this allowed us to increase the time efficiency of the code as the getMessagesFor() method did not need to sort through the messages based on recipient anymore. This benefit becomes especially obvious as well when there is a large number of messages that has to be stored, directed towards multiple users.

*3b. "read" command*

==== Current Implementation

Once the system is unlocked, you can access unread messages directed to you via the "showunread" command explained above.
Once action has been taken based on what the message sent to you is about, you can mark the message as read using the "read" command. Messages displayd in "showunread" command is first stored inside a static HashMap, with the key as the message index and the message itself as the value of the HashMap. When the user wishes to mark a message as read, he will type "read 'index'", and the respective message displayed at that specific index will be marked as read and updated in the message storage file of the user.
The "read" command can only be used after the "showunread" command has been used at least once successfully.

The following is an example usage scenario of the "read" command:

Step 1: User inputs his password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: User executes "showunread" command. If "showunread" command is successfully executed, a list of unread messages directed to the user will be displayed.

Step 3: Messages that are read from the user's inbox will also be recorded in a static HashMap called `recordNotifications`, with the message index used as the key.

Step 4: User executes "read 3" command. If 3 is a valid index (i.e. there were at least 3 unread messages that were displayed), the third message displayed will be marked as read.

Step 5: For the messages to be marked as read, the message itself is updated in the HashMap based on the index, and the message storage text file will be overwritten with the messages stored in the HashMap, effectively updating the read status of the message read.

Step 6: The CommandResult object displays to the user a message indicating that the updating of the read status was successful or not.

*3c. Request Backup feature"*

==== Current Implementation



*3d. Dispatch Backup feature"*

==== Current Implementation



*4. Autocorrection feature*

Current Implementation

The autocorrect mechanism is facilitated by use of dynamic programming.
The algorithm called EditDistance checks the number of single character
changes to be made to convert an invalid input into one expected by the
system. Currently, changes involving one single character can be corrected
by the system.
It implements the following operations:

. checkDistance() - It returns the edit distance needed to convert one
string to the other. In this case, it returns the number of single character
changes (either addition of a character, deletion of a character or changing
a character) to convert invalid user input into its most probable correct
implementation.
. getCommands() - This function returns the list of possible commands that
the user can input.

The following is an example usage scenario of the autocorrection feature:

Step 1: The user inputs his password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: The user enters an invalid command.

Step 3: The system predicts the most probable intended command the user
would have wanted to input, based on a threshold and then prompts the user
to use the prediction given in its valid format.

The input is checked by the algorithm in the MainWindow before it is sent
to the Parser class. This is to ensure invalid input can be caught by the
algorithm to give its correction before it is deemed as invalid by the Parser
during which time all commands will be laid out to the user.

Alternatives considered-

. Running the algorithm from the Parser- This however will not allow the
prediction to be reported efficiently.

. Include predictions with more than one character changes- This will bring
in ambiguity in the correction algorithm and increases chances of errors.
